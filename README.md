# Acorn-AIV-SCSI-Adapter-Card
A reproduction of the original Acorn AIV SCSI Adapter Card in KiCAD (as used in the BBC Domesday System)

For more information please see the [project wiki pages](https://github.com/simoninns/Acorn-AIV-SCSI-Adapter-Card/wiki)

## Synopsis

This card is designed as a drop-in replacement for the original Acorn card in the BBC Master Microcomputer and allows connection of SCSI devices (such as the Philips VP415 Domesday LaserDisc player).

The layout and routing of the board is based on the original and the board is therefore designed to use the same components.

## Motivation

The Acorn AIV SCSI board is difficult to source and commands a considerable sum on sites such as Ebay.  Using this project you are free to create your own boards for far less cost.  The design and schematics also act as a precise reference to the original design.  The original schematics are available on the web, however they are incorrect.  By recreating the board and following the original routing, the schematics included in this project are verified as correct.

## Author

The Acorn AIV SCSI Adapter Card issue 2 was designed by Simon Inns.
